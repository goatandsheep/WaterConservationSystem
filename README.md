WaterConservationSystem
=======================

This program is meant to control a water conservation system as to reduce water consumed by toilets. This is a greywater system that uses warm water from sinks and showers to fill toilets. Since the water is held in the tanks for a period of time, some of the heat will be dispersed into the washrooms.

This is inspired by toilets with built-in sinks, where the water from the sink runs into the toilet tank to fill it up. Here's an example: http://sinkpositive.com/web/

I wanted to make a project that embraces both my love for coding and my love for the environment. This is going to be a simple program that I'll probably never use, since Python is not optimal for these types of systems. It'll be used purely for demonstrating the logic behind it. Maybe down the line, there will be some multi-threading (even though Python can't really handle this properly).

Maybe, I'll include a cute GUI that will show where water is flowing. A little applet that will allow users to tell people to take showers/use toilet/etc.
