WaterConservationSystem
=======================

This program is meant to control a water conservation system as to reduce water consumed by toilets. This is a greywater system that uses warm water from sinks and showers to fill toilets. Since the water is held in the tanks for a period of time, some of the heat will be dispersed into the washrooms.

This is inspired by toilets with built-in sinks, where the water from the sink runs into the toilet tank to fill it up. Here's an example: http://sinkpositive.com/web/
